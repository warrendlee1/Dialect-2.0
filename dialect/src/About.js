                                    Dialect is a platform for thinkers to share and discuss their critical thoughts. 
                                    In our society, thought too often is contained within the bounds of oneâ€™s environments, or worse, a platform that encourages quick, snappy responses. 
                                    Dialect emphasizes moving away from this paradigm and towards provocative, thought-out responses that push significant ideas forward.
